      <h1>D22 Poster</h1>
      <p>D-22 was a live house in Beijing. Because the location is near the area of Universities, there gathered young people who love rock n roll. It gave a stage for different kinds of bands to perform. D-22 was the last place for people to be free and express their real feeling. It was the Utopia in Beijing, but it closed in 2009. There are still other live houses in Beijing, but they are more commercial. The Utopia of music seems to disappear completely. Even though I was only eight years old when D-22 was closed, I want it to reopen. This poster is the imagination of the reopen of D-22. I put all the bands I want to see and most of the words are Chinese because I want it to reopen in the same location in Beijing.
